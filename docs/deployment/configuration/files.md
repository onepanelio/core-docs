import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

There are two files generated after running `opctl init --provider <provider>`:

- `params.yaml` - contains the fields that need to be updated to configure your deployment.
- `config.yaml` - contains components that are going to be included in the deployment. This file **should not** be updated unless you plan on adding custom Kustomize components to your deployment.

For further information on populating the `params.yaml` file, refer to the sections below. This information is also available inside the generated `params.yaml` template.

:::tip
It is highly recommended that you commit `params.yaml` file into a private repository and encrypt it with [BlackBox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) or use a secret management service like [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/), [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [GCP Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) or [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
:::

## Content of configuration file `params.yaml`
:::important
The template below is automatically generated when your run `opctl init` for your provider.

This particular one was generated by running 
```shell script
opctl init --provider aks --enable-https --enable-cert-manager --dns-provider route53
```

    serviceAccountKey: |
      <key.json-file-data>
```

## Sections
What follows is a more detailed description of each section of the `params.yaml` file.

### application
This is where you set the basic application configuration. 

The `insecure` field is set to `true` by default and will be set to `false` if you add the `--enable-https` when running `opctl init`.

#### defaultNamespace
This is the first [Namespace](/docs/getting-started/concepts/namespaces) you want created. This could be a project name or a team name. It is set to `default` by default but we recommend you use something more meaningful.

#### domain
This is the domain for your Onepanel resources. Some resources like Workspaces create subdomains of this domain so they can be accessed by a browser. This can be a top level domain like `example.com` or a subdomain `sub.example.com`.

:::important
Domains, not ip addresses, are required with Istio.
:::

#### fqdn
This is where Onepanel UI and API will be deployed. This should be a subdomain of the `domain` field mentioned above. For example: `app.example.com` or `app.sub.example.com`.

:::important
Domains, not ip addresses, are required with Istio.
:::

#### insecure
The `insecure` field is set to `true` by default and will be set to `false` if you add the `--enable-https` when running `opctl init`.

#### nodePool
Depending on your provider, these are either called node pools or node groups. They are labels on Kubernetes nodes that Onepanel uses for auto scaling nodes on demand.

A common `label` to identify these is `beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type` which most cloud providers automatically set. The value of this label is usually set to the instance type of the cloud provider.

You can see all labels on your nodes by running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

:::note
For minikube, you can use this configuration.
```yaml
nodePool:
  label: minikube.k8s.io/name
  options:
  - name: 'Minikube'
    value: minikube
```

Verify with:
```shell script
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

The label has to exist for workspaces to run.
:::

Note that this lists many different labels, so you can pick and choose any label key/value that is unique to that node.

For example after running the `kubectl` command above, you may get the following list of labels:

```bash {3}
agentpool=nodepool1,
beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,
beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=Standard_D2s_v3,
beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,
failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=eastus,
```

You can then use the label key/value pairs as follows:

```yaml {2,4-5}
nodePool:
  label: beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type  # node label key
  options:
    - name: 'CPU: 2, RAM: 8GB'      # friendly name for instance
      value: 'Standard_D2s_v3'      # node label value
    - name: 'CPU: 4, RAM: 16GB'
      value: Standard_D4s_v3
    - name: 'GPU: 1xK80, CPU: 6, RAM: 56GB'
      value: Standard_NC6
```

### artifactRepository
This section allows you to setup the default object storage for your Workflow and Workspace artifacts, which includes Workflow log storage. Onepanel currently supports any S3 compatible artifact repository such as AWS, GCS and Minio. Support for additional object storages is coming soon.

Here's an example AWS S3 configuration:

```yaml
artifactRepository:
  s3:
    accessKey: AKIAJSIE27KKMHXI3BJQ
    bucket: pipelines.example.com
    endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com
    region: us-west-2
    secretKey: 5bEYu26084qjSFyclM/f2pz4gviSfoOg+mFwBH39
```

Here's an example Google Cloud GCS configuration:

```yaml
artifactRepository:
 gcs:
    bucket: mygreatbucket
    endpoint: storage.googleapis.com
    insecure: false
    keyFormat: artifacts/{{workflow.namespace}}/{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}}
    serviceAccountKey: |
      {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "my-project-id",
        "private_key_id": "private_key_id",
        "private_key": "private_key",
        "client_email": "client_email",
        "client_id": "client_id",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "cert_url"
      }
```

:::note
You can get the serviceAccount JSON via gcloud.
```shell script
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
   --iam-account ACCOUNT_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
:::

:::important
Onepanel Workflows will automatically upload or download artifacts from `artifacts/{{workflow.namespace}}/{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}}`. See [Workflow artifacts](/docs/reference/workflows/templates#artifacts) for more information.
:::

### certManager
If you have run `opctl init` with `--enable-https`, `--enable-cert-manager` and `--dns-provider` flags set, you need to configure your respective DNS provider here so that Onepanel can create and renew your TLS certificates for you.

See [TLS certificates](/docs/deployment/configuration/tls) for more information about configuring this section.

### database
This is the database settings section.

#### Production database
For a production deployment, use a managed PostgresSQL database like [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Azure Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/) or [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql).

Note that you can update your settings as many times as you like and simply run `opctl apply` again to update your your database settings in the cluster.

Example production database settings:

```yaml
database:
  databaseName: onepanel
  driverName: postgres
  host: my-onepanel-db.postgres.database.azure.com
  password: verystrongproductionpassword
  port: 5432
  username: onepanel
```

#### Test database

For a test cluster, you can set the database `host` to `postgres` and use any `username` or `password`. This database will be automatically created in the cluster with the information you entered.

Note that you cannot change the username/password for the test database once it's created, so if you make a mistake, you will have to delete the test database and run `opctl apply` again:

```bash
# delete test database and its related volume
kubectl delete statefulset postgres -n onepanel
kubectl delete pvc postgres-pv-claim-postgres-0 -n onepanel

# Update your database settings

# Run opctl apply again to recreate the test database
opctl apply
```

Example test database settings:

```yaml
database:
  databaseName: onepanel
  driverName: postgres
  host: postgres
  password: mypassword
  port: 5432
  username: onepanel
```

### metalLB
This is to configure a load balancer for local or bare-metal deployments.

Example:
```yaml
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
# Component: Application and kubernetes load balancing on non-cloud deployments.
# Description: MetalLB, LoadBalancer
# CLI flag: --enable-metallb
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
metalLb:
  addresses:
  - 10.1.31.1/24
```

Getting the address range
<Tabs
  defaultValue="minikube"
  values={[
    { label: 'Minikube', value: 'minikube', },
    { label: 'Microk8s', value: 'microk8s', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="minikube">

First, find minikube's ip.

```shell script
minikube ip
```

For the first part of the range, use `minikube ip + 1`

So if `minikube ip` gives us `192.168.64.64`

We use `192.168.64.65`

For the second part of the range, change the last part to `255`

So we can use a range of `192.168.64.65` to `192.168.64.255`

```yaml
metalLb:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.64.65-192.168.64.255
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="microk8s">

Get inside the VM of multipass.

```shell script
multipass shell microk8s-vm
```

```shell script
ifconfig -a
```

You'll get something like this
```shell script
cni0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1450
        inet 10.1.31.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 0.0.0.0
        inet6 fe80::58ce:8dff:fe5e:2be5  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 5a:ce:8d:5e:2b:e5  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 37251  bytes 4363323 (4.3 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 38095  bytes 9152263 (9.1 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
[...Other output...]
```

We want CNI because it's the Container Network Interface.

In our case, we have `10.1.31.1`

So we can use `10.1.31.0/24` for a range of `10.1.31.0` to `10.1.31.255`

```yaml
metalLb:
  addresses:
  - 10.1.31.1/24
# or
# - 10.1.31.0 - 10.1.31.255
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### workflowEngine
#### containerRuntimeExecutor
The executor workflow engine uses to perform certain actions like monitoring pod logs, collecting artifacts, managing container lifecycles, etc.

The possible values are `docker` and `pns`:

- `docker` is more reliable, however it mounts the `docker.sock` of the host makes it less secure.
- `pns` is more secure, however in some versions of Kubernetes, it tends to fail on tasks that take less than 15 seconds.

<!-- ### services

Services are additional tools or applications you want to install alongside the main deployment.
These are set up to allow distributed workloads and are always available, unlike Workspaces.

Each Service has its own configuration, consult the [Services reference](/docs/reference/services/overview) for more information.

Here's an example of adding a [ModelDB](https://github.com/VertaAI/modeldb) Service.

```yaml
services:
  modelDb:
    artifactRepository:
      s3:
        # An s3 bucket to store your modeldb artifacts
        bucket: example-modeldb-test
        region: us-west-2
    database:
      # The name of the database where modeldb records will be stored.
      # This will be automatically created if it does not exist
      databaseName: modeldb
      # This must be a database that already exists. It is used to establish a connection
      # so the system can create the databaseName.
      defaultDatabaseName: postgres
``` -->
