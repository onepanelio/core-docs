This document outlines the installation steps for single node installation using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/).

## Install Minikube

See [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Once Minikube is installed, start it with at least 8 Gigabytes of RAM, 4 CPUs, and 40G of storage (for Istio) â€“ you can pass these requirements as follows:

```bash
minikube start --driver=virtualbox --memory '8gb' --cpus=4 --disk-size '40g' \
    --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-signing-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/sa.key \
    --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/sa.pub \
    --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-issuer=api \
    --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-api-audiences=api,nats \
    --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```

You can now find the IP address which has been allocated by running:

```bash
minikube ip
```

Take a note of this IP as you will need to add it to your `params.yaml`.

## Install Onepanel

1. Download the latest `opctl` for your operating system from [our release page](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/releases/latest).

2. Run the following command to initialize a `params.yaml` template for minikube:

```bash
opctl init --provider minikube
```

3. Populate `params.yaml` by following the instructions in the template, you can also refer to the [configuration files](/docs/deployment/configuration/files) section.

4. Finally, run the following command to deploy to your cluster:

```bash
opctl apply
```

:::important
The CLI will display the URL for accessing Onepanel once the deployment completes.

5. Use the following command to get your auth token to log into Onepanel:

```bash
opctl auth token
