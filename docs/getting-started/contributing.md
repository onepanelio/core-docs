Welcome to Onepanel CE Project! We are excited to have you as part of the community and welcome all contributions.

## Getting started as a contributor
This document outlines project structure, guidelines and serves as a single source of truth for contributions. Our goal is to make it as easy for everyone to contribute to the code base, documentation, and components.

## Code of conduct
Make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Coding conventions
All code should be written in the languages and frameworks listed below and follow that language's conventions. SDKs for different languages are an exception and should follow the best practices for that language.

### Go
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- [Go code review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

### TypeScript and Angular
- [Angular coding style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)

### SDKs
All SDKs should be generated with [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli) using our generated [API specification file](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/blob/master/api/api.swagger.json). See our Python SDK's [Makefile](https://github.com/onepanelio/python-sdk/blob/master/Makefile) for reference.

## Documentation style guide
We welcome all contributions and follow these highlights from [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).

Our documentation site is built on [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
